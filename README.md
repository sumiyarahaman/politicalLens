Project Description: The purpose of this project is to take urls of new articles from the internet and determine political bias of the articles using a rule based approach. In this process, I utilized a predefined list of words for each side and compared it to words in the article. I determined political bias by the highest count of words from a specific predefined list(right, left, or neutral).
